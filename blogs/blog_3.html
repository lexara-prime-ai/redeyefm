                    The idea of marriage has evolved significantly over the years, yet it is still largely rooted in
                    traditional gender roles and societal norms. Therefore, it might be beneficial to rethink the
                    conventional concept of marriage and explore new models that better reflect the contemporary values
                    and beliefs.
                </span>
            </p>

            <p class="content small">
                To begin with, the classic notion of marriage places a lot of gravity on gender roles, wherein men are
                expected to be the main breadwinners while women are anticipated to manage the home and children. This
                can cause instability in power distribution, which consequently leads to dissatisfaction among both
                partners.

                Moreover, it is also questionable to expect marriages to last a lifetime as situations may arise that
                bring about drastic changes in either one or both partnersâ€™ lives or personalities over time. This could
                produce a sense of being stuck in an inconsistent relationship where none of them have their needs met
                anymore.
            </p>

            <p class="content small">
                Finally, traditional marriages do not take into account the multiplicity of human relationships and
                encounters. People might find blissfulness and contentment in unconventional relationship models that do
                not follow traditional marriage principles.

                In conclusion, although marriage can be an incredibly fulfilling experience, often times its
                conventional concept restricts its focus on gender roles, lifelong commitment and customary norms. By
                revisiting this concept of marriage with an open mind towards different models that better mirror modern
                values and beliefs, we can cultivate a more comprehensive and satisfying connection for everyone
                involved.

                an opinion on piece on why traditional marriage structures should be reviewed.
