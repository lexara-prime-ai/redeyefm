                    The recent rise in self-improvement culture has sparked a drive among many to optimize
                    their lives and reach perfection.
                </span>
            </p>

            <p class="content small">
                To begin with, the continuous strain to better oneself can lead to obsessive self-criticism and doubt.
                People may feel they are not making enough progress in spite of their hard work, which can bring about
                feelings of despair, dejection, and exhaustion. This pressure may also cause comparison and competition
                between others that lead to a feeling of inadequacy.

                Furthermore, the concentrated focus on self-improvement may cause people to forget about major societal
                issues that need collective action. Instead of fighting poverty, inequality, or environmental
                destruction, individuals could become much more focused on their own advancement and success. This could
                cause social irresponsibility and disconnection from broader society.

                In addition, this ideal of self-improvement might reinforce existing oppressive systems by putting an
                emphasis on personal discipline and responsibility instead of recognizing external factors such as race,
                gender or socio-economic status which limit opportunities for success. This perpetuates the false idea
                that meritocracy exists while blaming individuals instead of highlighting systemic challenges they face.


            </p>

            <p class="content small">
                To make matters worse, the culture of self-improvement is often expensive and restricted to wealthy
                people with privileged access to resources or chances for success - resulting in an industry becoming
                more profitable due to individual insecurities as well as an impression that achievements are only
                possible for those with large financial means.

                Summed up: although self-improvement can be beneficial for personal growth it brings with it certain
                dangers that must be acknowledged; such as an unhealthy fixation on perfection accompanied by
                competitive pressure and the reinforcement of prejudiced power dynamics - while ignoring collective
                solutions or social justice causes; all within a system based on privileged access and monetary wealth.
